Or 

Say “Hi!” on LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/abdibrokhim 

I’ve participated in over 50 hackathons and challenges.

I’ve built over 50 cool projects.

Here are few of them, lessgoo;

In the last hackathon, I faced some issues while working with Langflow (https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow). As a beginner to this platform, I could not figure out which component connects to which component edges. Then I thought, what if I automate it using AI? It would be an AI-powered AI, haha. We automated Langflow with AI. No more drag and drop; simply dictate, and AI gets the work done!

And, for other projects;

Please kindly check my LinkedIn projects section (https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdibrokhim/details/projects). Everything is written in detail with cool graphics and extra links.

You’ll not regret it. They’re all really interesting.

Aysara Nuratdinova,MECA at Uzbekistan,Uzbekistan,Chemical & Materials Engineering,"Hello! I’m Aysara, a 21-year-old from Karakalpakstan, near the Aral Sea. My background is deeply rooted in environmental (inc clean air, clean water and clean energy) and gender equality initiatives, driven by my experiences growing up in a region where these issues are particularly pressing.

One of my key projects is an eco-initiative in Nukus City. This project aims to enhance waste management and recycling practices by installing five waste sorting collection points throughout the city. To make it easier for residents, we’ve integrated these points into a mobile app and Telegram bot. Participants who actively sort and recycle waste have the chance to earn vouchers for a three-month English language course. This effort not only promotes environmental responsibility but also fosters community engagement and education.

In addition to environmental work, I am passionate about gender equality. I’ve spearheaded a social project aimed at empowering 20 female students from grades 9-11 at School 52 in Kungrad, Karakalpakstan. This initiative provides a three-month digital skills course focusing on social media marketing (SMM) and graphic design. With over 58.7% of women in Uzbekistan being unemployed and fulfill the role of traditional homemakers, this project is designed to prevent gender inequality and financial dependence by equipping young women with valuable, marketable skills."," swimming, journalling, embroidery, photography, baking","SDG5 - Gender Equality,SDG6 - Clean Water & Sanitation,SDG11 - Sustainable Cities & Communities,SDG13 - Climate Action,SDG1 - No Poverty,SDG2 - Zero Hunger",IMG_20240724_024101_656.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728086400000/ujT0DEIgPwr49aEZwisnmw/xt_Vcz4KfHrTnqPtlr4xocz2Aa37pqG_srqzlj0shpWb2juHadBItFsVaANh-tkF3WP614yTP2qhvqSvvYho7IcLYGGagGPj34PdptQ85T84aXwDt-QtVeC9T-Of91jAFrKOGfVlsX0FBXAFhjJNwdAohObD4XtNEjmfgysrax0LGxuO4iCpU-GvN0e2vQWE/EkozLm5mrKxRpzif6dD_RBVs26cP-a0-OWTALNb4lrI)

Masa Aladwan ,MECA at Uzbekistan,Jordan ,Data Science ,"I am currently a Data Science student at Al-Balqa Applied University, specializing in artificial intelligence. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++.

Throughout my studies, I have undertaken various projects that combine both software and hardware components. For instance, I recently completed an IoT and Arduino development project with my teammate, Mohammad Moataz. This project involved creating machine learning models for weather forecasting, developing a mobile application and graphical user interface (GUI), and integrating Arduino-based hardware for real-time environmental monitoring.

Another notable project is ""The Simpsons Sentiment Analysis,"" where we analyzed script data from the TV show to gain insights into character dialogues, sentiment, and viewer engagement metrics. We used Power BI for visualization and employed techniques like TF-IDF Vectorizer and TextBlob for sentiment analysis.

Additionally, I have worked on several significant projects, including:
- Diabetes Prediction: Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data.
- Cerebral Stroke Prediction: Created a predictive model to assess the risk of cerebral strokes using medical data.
- KnowledgeKapture: An educational project aimed at capturing and organizing knowledge efficiently for enhanced learning experiences.
- Vision Project: This project had three parts:
  1. Lane Detection: Implemented a Python script using OpenCV to perform edge detection and image enhancement with the Sobel operator, aiding in precise lane tracking for applications like autonomous vehicles.
  2. Inverting Signals: Used OpenCV and NumPy for image inversion, effectively creating a photographic negative of an input image.
  3. Sharpening Filter: Applied the Unsharp Masking technique in OpenCV to sharpen images, enhancing details and edges for image processing applications.

In addition to my academic projects, I have experience with database management using SQL, data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh, and I am well-versed in computer network security and AI programming. I have also visited Germany for the RL4eng project, which provided me with valuable international exposure to academic and research environments.

These experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded skill set and a deep passion for leveraging data to solve real-world problems and drive innovation.","In my free time, I love to draw using pencil, ink, and acrylic on canvas. I listen to all kinds of music, including Arabic and English, spanning various genres. Reading is another passion of mine, and I enjoy a wide range of books, including mysteries, thrillers, historical fiction, science fiction and fantasy.
